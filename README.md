This is a (very much) work in progress which creates a typical "now playing" banner with the song title, label, and artowrk of the currently playing song.

It's designed to be used as an overlay in an app such as OBS for streaming or local visuals.

This is cinsidered mroe of a proof of concept in it's current state and requires a lot of work. More details will follow as things progress :)
